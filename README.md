RimModelled is a mod manager for [RimWorld](https://rimworldgame.com). It allows you to enable and reorder mods, and provides features to organize them.

## Features

- :open_file_folder: Organize your mods into folders for easy access.
- :mag: Search your mod list.
- :thinking: Add a note to any mod or folder (remind yourself why you have a mod disabled).
- :zap: Load the mod list of an existing save (stop restarting RimWorld to change the mods).
- :handshake: Save modlists for later use, or copy to clipboard (compatible with [Fluffy Mod Manager](https://github.com/fluffy-mods/ModManager)).
- :tv: [Watch a demo](https://vimeo.com/641769692) for details!

## Installation

Presently, RimModelled only works on macOS with Steam. If you fall into that bucket, then you can download the latest from the [releases](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/RimModelled) page.

If you don't fall into that bucket, not to worry! RimModelled should work fine with Windows, Linux, and the DRM-free version. However, I haven't been able to test them yet. If you want to be a guinea pig, open up [an issue](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/RimModelled/issues)!

## Future

The roadmap for RimModelled is flexible, but I'd like to add these features in the future:

- Support for Windows, Linux, and DRM-free versions of RimWorld.
- A graphical overhaul. If you would like to contribute a logo or theme for the app, [get in touch](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/RimModelled/issues)!
- Keyboard shortcuts.
- Translations to other languages.
- Deeper integration with Steam Workshop (open mod in Workshop, unsubscribe from mod, etc.).

If you would like to see something in RimModelled, let me know via [an issue](https://github.com/CGamesPlay/RimModelled/issues).
